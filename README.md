The following features will receive priority in pull request approval. 

1. Maps: integrate Maps (eg Google Maps) for each location based on latitude/longitude
2. Error Handling: incorporate better tests & error handling into API calls and component rendering
3. Design: design should be significantly improved, including colors, transitions, and fonts. A Svelte component library should be considered to optimize & stylize components.
